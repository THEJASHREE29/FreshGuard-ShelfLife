FreshGuard: AI-Powered Shelf-Life Prediction and Waste Reduction for Fruits & Vegetables Project Overview

FreshGuard is a machine learning project designed to classify fruits and vegetables as fresh or rotten using image data. The model predicts the shelf life of produce, helping to reduce food waste by providing actionable recommendations for packaging and distribution.

Features

Classifies fruits and vegetables as fresh or rotten with high accuracy

Predicts approximate shelf life based on freshness

Provides recommendations to optimize storage and shipment

Built using deep learning with transfer learning (MobileNetV2)

Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow & Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

Google Colab (for development and training)

Dataset

The model is trained on the publicly available Fruits Fresh and Rotten for Classification dataset -- https://www.kaggle.com/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification


How to Use

1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FreshGuard-ShelfLife.git


2. Open the notebook
FreshGuard.ipynb in Google Colab or your local Jupyter environment.

3. Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run the notebook cells to train or test the model.

5. Upload an image of a fruit or vegetable to get a freshness prediction and shelf life estimate.
